      # the architectures we want to compile test against, and Dockerfile uses
      # Debian (which does).

      # XXX: as currently this is the only job that is using Docker, we are
      # building and using the runcimage locally. In case more jobs running
      # under Docker will emerge, it will be good to have a separate make
      # runcimage job and share its result (the docker image) with whoever
      # needs it.
